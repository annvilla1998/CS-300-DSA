# CS-300-DSA

Throughout this course I had the chance to learn and analyze different data structures specifically using C++. After analyzing the benefits of using a vector, a hash table, and a tree for my project, considering run time and space, I decided a vector was the best structure to use for my project. For my project, I had to write software that would read a list of courses from a given file and offer the user a menu of different things to do with these courses. Before approaching the problem, it's best to fully understand each option along with their benefits and drawbacks. Every data structure is built differently and is made for different jobs, otherwise there wouldn't be more than one data structure. When choosing the best one for the job, you'll want to know how it's implemented, what methods it offers, etc. Knowing all of these things will provide a checklist after distingushing what is needed to get your job done. I overcame any roadblocks by using my resources such as stack overflow and C++ documentation. This project helped me understand that mapping out a plan before coding it is super important and makes it 10x easier to write fully functioning code faster.
